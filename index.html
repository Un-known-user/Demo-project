    Hi
    so three things
    1> unmodified
    2> untracked
    3> staged
    <!-- Modified -->
    When we add or change anything to our code we do two steps 1st one is add and 2nd one is commit, when we add the status become staged and after commit it become modified and if not done anything then untracked and if we haven't done any chage since cretion of file then unmodified.
    \for adding we have to write git add <File name> (git add index.html)
    \for commiting we have to write git commit -m <some messege about this update>
         ( git commit -m "add new button/ add new feature/fixed a bug" )
</body>
