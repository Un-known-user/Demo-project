    Hi
    so three things
    1> unmodified
    2> untracked
    3> staged
    <!-- Modified -->
    When we add or change anything to our code we do two steps 1st one is add and 2nd one is commit, when we add the status become staged and after commit it become modified and if not done anything then untracked and if we haven't done any chage since cretion of file then unmodified.
    \for adding we have to write git add <File name> (git add index.html)
    \for commiting we have to write git commit -m <some messege about this update>
    ( git commit -m "add new button/ add new feature/fixed a bug" )


    Now all thing is done on our local system and need to be push on git (upload local repo content to remote {Local means - my computer and remote means git.} )
    so we run push command ---> git push origin main
